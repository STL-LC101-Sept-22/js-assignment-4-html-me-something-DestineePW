          <h2>Bakers Math</h2>
          <p>
            When baking professionally, we use bakers Math. Bakers Math is a way
            to express the ratio of ingredients to one another by weight.
            Each ingredient in a formula is expressed as a percentage of the
            largest ingredient, which is usually flour. The weight of the flour
            is always expressed as 100%.

          <h2>Mixing the dough</h2>
          <p>
            The dough starts out just like a lean dough with very humble
            ingredients; Flour, salt, water, and a leavening agent like
            yeast.<br />
            These ingredients alone will proucde bread with a chewy texture,
            more bite and a crisp crust. (Think pizza dough or a french
            baguette).<br />
            An enriched dough is made tender and soft with the addition of
            butter, sugar and milk. <br />To make croissants, we want a lightly
            enriched dough with moderate gluten strength.

          <h1>Fermentation</h1>
          <p>
            Once all of our ingredients are icroporated and our dough is smooth
            and soft its time to allow our dough to rest. We do this for several
            reasons;
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              We want the gluten in our dough to become hydrated, relax and
              reform into long protein chains that will provide our croissants
              with structure.
            </li>
            <li>
              We want to give the living yeast in our dough time to feed on the
              sugars and expel CO2, which causes the dough to rise.
            </li>
            <li>
              We want to give the dough flavor. When the yeast convert sugar to
              carbon dioxide they also create flavorful acids (like the twang of
              sourdough).
            </li>

          <h2>Butter</h2>
          <p>
            Butter is the most important ingredient for making french
            croissants. It's important to use a good quality european butter
            with at lease %82 fat. The bulk of the butter in croissants is the
            Tourrage, the cold butter block that will be encased in the dough.
            To make the Tourrage you take slightly softened butter and roll it
            out to a thin, even square.

          <h2>Locking in the butter</h2>
          <p>
            The butter is placed on the dough and the dough is then folded
            around it to lock in the butter. There are different methods to
            accomplish this but I prefer the envelope-fold. An envelope-fold
            places the butter diagonally on top of the dough rolled out to a
            square. Each corner of the dough is brought to the center locking
            the butter inside the dough. Once the butter is folded in the dough
            is chilled.

          <h2>Lamination</h2>
          <p>
            Lamination is the process of folding and rolling butter into dough
            over and over again to create thin layers. These layers, which
            alternate between butter and dough, are what give croissants their
            signature honeycomb interior and flaky texture. To achieve the
            desired layers in our croissants we do a series of folds, chilling
            the dough between folds. There are calculators like
            <a
              href="https://observablehq.com/@mourner/laminated-dough-calculator"
              >this one</a
            >
            to help you achieve the desired amount of layers.

          <h2>Shaping</h2>
          <p>
            Once the lamination process is complete the croissants are shaped
            into their characteristic crescent shape by cutting the dough into
            triangles and rolling from the wide edge towards the tip. They may
            also be cut into rectangles, filled with chocolate, almond paste, or
            other ingredients, and then rolled. They are proofed, brushed with
            eggwash, and allowed to rise until doubled in size.

          <h2>Baking</h2>
          <p>
            Once the croissants have doubled in size they are brushed with
            another layer of eggwash and placed in a hot oven to bake until they
            are glossy and have a beautiful carmel color.
          </p>
          <div class="container">
            <figure>
              <img
                src=".github\images\Croissant Making\croissant-making (1).jpg"
                alt="Croissants"
              />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            When the croissants are done, resist the temptation to eat them
            immediately! Easier said than done, but allow them time to cool so
            their internal structure can set. If they came out perfect, you can
            expect incredibly crispy, flaky layers in your croissant, with a
            glossy look on the surface. And when you cut into a croissants,
            you’ll be greeted with a beautiful, honeycomb crumb.
